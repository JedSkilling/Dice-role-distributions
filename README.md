Dice role distribution calculator
Takes in a set of dice to roll, eg d6 + 2x d10 + d20 and calculates the distribution for the sum of the dice.

This is done deterministicly, rather than by simulating each dice role, and the method is based of Markov Chains.

There is currently not a proper UI, to test specific dice roll combinations you edit the diceToRole vector.
